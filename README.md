# zombies
A 2-D survival game written in JavaScript. The p5.js library is used for most of
 the image processing/drawing.

## Basic Idea
The player spawns inside of a house. The windows of the house are boarded up
with shutters. After some time passes, zombies will spawn and walk toward the
house. They will break down the shutters and enter the house. Once they are
inside, they will proceed to chase the player.

## How to Play
The player can move left, right, up, and/or down using the standard W-A-S-D keys.

`W - UP`

`A - LEFT`

`S - DOWN`

`D - RIGHT`

The player can shoot projectiles in the direction specified by a mouse click.
For example, if the player is in the middle of the house and you want to shoot
toward the right wall, the mouse should be clicked on that side of the player.
